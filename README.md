V-Ball (Voiceball) is a DIY throwable act of defiance housed in a tennis ball, designed to play audio in a continuous loop. It’s a low-tech, open-source, unconnected object amplifying muted voices against censorship, surveillance and oppression.

## HOW TO MAKE A V-BALL





**Part List:**

*DFPlayer Mini, Arduino Pro Mini (5V), USB-TTL Module, 3.3Vto 5V Voltage Booster Module, 3.7V 250mAh Li-Po Battery, 8 Ω speaker (50 mm), SD Card (< 32GB), Tennis Ball*

  

***1. Flash Sd Card / Upload your .mp3 file***

  

DFPlayer does not support SD cards bigger than 32GB. Flash your SD card to FAT32. Upload your sound (only mp3). Name it ‘0001.mp3’.

  

***2. Upload Code to Arduino***

  

Use USB-TTL Module to upload your code to Arduino.

  


***3. Prepare the Ball***

  

Place your speaker on the tennis ball and draw an outline. Cut your ball accordingly. Drill two holes on top for the activator switch.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

***4. Make the Circuit***

  

Wire everything as the schematic shows. Cables for the switch should be relatively long.

***5. Assemble V-Ball***

  

Plug your SD Card in. Test your circuit. Stuff everything inside the ball. Stick the wires for the switch from the holes you drilled. To make it more durable you can hot glue the speaker while closing.

 ***6. Attend Protest*** 

Bring some tape with you to secure your V-Ball.

(optional) Paint V-Ball to black to make it harder to detect.



***7. Throw it!***

  

Tape sticking switch wires to activate V-Ball. Wait for the activation. Your sound will loop endlessly until the battery dies. Throw it to your desired oppressor.
